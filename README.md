# Projects

This is a repository that contains all of my projects made until today. The idea is for this file to work as a portfolio for all my projects.
Inside some of the projects there is also a readme.md file where I explain step by step what my ideas where, how I applied them and also a step by step of my code.
The files that have a readme.md file are projects with a bigger purpose than the other projects. These projects are web-apps that I had an idea to make, not 
only as learning material. The projects without a readme.md are projects related to the course web50 from Edx and Harvard. Those projects where made with the intention of 
learning how to code with some instructions given.
For future projects that I will make, all of them will have a readme.md file in its folder.

For the projects that do not have a readme.md file in it, here a brief idea of what those projects contain.

The commerce project:
It is basically an e-commerce web application. Web-app made using Django alongside python, HTML, CSS and SQL. The idea behind this project was to make a
simple e-commerce, where people can place auctions, can bid on others auctions, can comment on them and, when the owner of the auction closes it, the user can win 
the auction as well. Its a place where you can buy or sell goods you do not wish anymore and you can make auctions with it, the more interesting something is, the more 
bids it will have. A place that is very simple to see whats for sale. In addition, there are filter for categories, since each auction is related to a category
you can filter by the cateogories of your interest. Auctions, users and categories are stored in the database using Django models. Video showing the web-app:

The mail project:
The mail project is a simulation of a mail service/web-app. Web-app made using Django alongsde Python, HTML, CSS and SQL. This app make use of django models
to store the users and the mails sent. Users that receive the email are able to answer it, and when they first read it the app will change the mail colour to mark
it as read. Users can archive emails and also answer them as much as they can. Video showing the web-app: https://youtu.be/f2cygIhT32c

The project0 (search) project:
This was my first made app that will simulate the googles search page. It is made using only HTML, CSS and python. Is a pretty simple page where you can do a normal 
google search, an image search or an advanced search. The idea for this web-app is to train CSS properties and to train more of linking pages to one another and giving 
request to the url with different properties. Video showing the web-app: https://youtu.be/yQcAq6TOD40

The project1/wiki:
This is a very interesting project. This was the first time I had to do a web-app using Django, alongside with HTML and CSS and python. For this project there is no
use of Django models since I have leaned it only after this project. This web-app is similar to wikipedia. The idea is that user can create entries and give them 
description/explanation. Users can edit other entries as well, much alike wikipedia itself. The home page will list and link all entries. Video showing the web-app:

The project4 (network):
This is alongside the final_project my most complex project. This uses a lot of Django, now alongside javascript and python, with HTML, CSS, SQL. This web-app
is to be a twitter like social media, where users can post what they are thinking, they can like other users post, they can follow other users, they can edit their
post and also has a pagination functionallity. All is implemented using python except for editing a post and liking a post, those are made using javascript, so 
that the page must not refresh after a request from the user. The javascript is used with json so that the program can fetch from the user what they wnat to input exactlly.
The pagination function is made with a distinct framework and its used with python. There is also a login, logout and register function so that some of the web-apps 
functionallities are only visible for logged in users. In the file called models.py we can see all the models we make use of. Here is the link of the video
